### Introduction

This Implementation Guide is based on [FHIR R4](https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/).  
It defines the structure and content of the **Laboratory Result Report Message** in the Czech national context, aligned with the European eHN guidelines.  
The goal is to standardize the electronic format of laboratory result reporting for data exchange between laboratories, healthcare providers, and national systems (e.g., NZIS).  

The guide describes
